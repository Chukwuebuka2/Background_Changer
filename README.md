# Background_Changer

This project is a basic JavaScript project that changes the background color randomly by clicking a button.
In this project, I just applied basic operation in manipulating a string in JavaScript to generate random hex codes that 
will enable us to change the background of the site. 

## How?
Click on the change color button and watch the background change.


[Here is a live demo of this project](https://github.com/Chukwuebuka2/Background_Changer)
